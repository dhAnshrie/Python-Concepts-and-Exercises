## Conditionals

This section covers questions related to `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python. You'll find exercises that require decision-making based on various conditions.

## Loops

Explore exercises on `for` and `while` loops. These questions help you understand how to iterate over data structures and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Lists

This section focuses on Python lists, including operations like appending, slicing, and list comprehensions.

## Tuples

Learn about immutable sequences in Python with these tuple-related exercises. Topics include tuple unpacking and operations.

## Dictionaries

Practice working with key-value pairs using Python dictionaries. This section includes questions on adding, updating, and accessing dictionary items.

This section covers the fundamentals of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## List Comprehensions

Learn to use list comprehensions for creating lists efficiently. This section includes exercises that involve generating lists based on certain conditions or transformations.

## Lambda Functions

Explore lambda functions, which provide a way to create small, anonymous functions. This section includes exercises on using lambda functions in various contexts.


## Usage

To use these exercises, simply clone the repository and navigate to the desired section. Each section contains a Python file with the corresponding exercises and their solutions.
